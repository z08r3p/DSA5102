DSA5102 Programming   Assignment   2
Due:   20   October   2024The   goal   of this   assignment   is   to   get   you   started   on   your   final   project.    You   should   have   (or   should   do   so   now)   identiﬁed   a   potential   dataset   to   work   on.      Refer   to   project   instructions   with   data   resources   if you   have   trouble   deciding on a dataset. Try to ﬁnd something that’s   interesting   and   unusual!
In a   Jupyter notebook:
1.    Introduce your   dataset   of choice   and perform. basic   data visualization   (you will   improve   upon  代 写DSA5102 Programming Assignment 2Matlab
代做程序编程语言 these   later   in   your project)
2.    Introduce an unsupervised learning problem   statement   (dimensionality reduction,   clustering,   etc)   and   apply   a method to solve the problem (PCA, autoencoders, K-means clustering,   etc)
3.    Discuss any interesting ﬁndings
Please   use   the   markdown   features   of   Jupyter   to   document your   steps.    You will   receive   feedback,   which will   help   you with your project.
You are allowed to re-use content   from this   programming   assignment   in your   final   project.
